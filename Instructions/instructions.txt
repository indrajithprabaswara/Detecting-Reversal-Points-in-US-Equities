Detecting Reversal Points in US Equities
Predict local highs and lows in anonymized stock data


Overview
Local highs/lows (reversals) are among the marketâ€™s most actionable signalsâ€”and the hardest to pinpoint in real time. Your challenge is to build a model that detects these reversal points from anonymized stock (stk) data using a mix of raw features and boolean Signal Descriptors.

Description
A financial time series consists of continuous price movements with intermittent turning points. Traders call these reversals â€” local highs and lows where the market direction shifts.

This competition challenges you to classify swing points in anonymized stock data. Using both raw numerical features (momentum and ratios) and boolean Signal Descriptors, youâ€™ll build models that map reversal points into one of the four classical swing categories:

H: Local or Global High

L: Local or Global Low

None: Not a swing point

These labels define market structure and are widely used in trend analysis, chart pattern recognition, and algorithmic trading.

Participants will train on a provided dataset (train.csv) and submit models that Kaggle will score against a hidden validation set.

Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated on the hidden validation set using:

Primary Metric

Macro F1-score â€” treats all swing classes equally, regardless of class imbalance.

Tie-breakers (in order)

Macro Balanced Accuracy

Matthews Correlation Coefficient (multi-class)

Inference runtime

This ensures that winning models capture swing structure across all four categories, not just the majority class.

Dataset Description
Time Series Classification Competition Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains time series data from 6 anonymized financial instruments for classification tasks.

Dataset Statistics
Total Samples: 2,760
Features: 68504 (excluding metadata and target)
Time Period: 2023-04-03 to 2025-01-31
Unique Tickers: 6
Target Variable
class_label: The target variable for 3-class classification
Multi-class classification (3 classes): ['H', 'L', 'None']
Class H: 82 samples (3.0%)
Class L: 81 samples (2.9%)
Class None: 2597 samples (94.1%)

Class Conversion Mapping:
Original -> New:
HH, LH -> H (High patterns)
HL, LL -> L (Low patterns)
Others -> None (No clear pattern)
Missing/NaN values converted to None: 2597 samples

Problem Definition
This is a 3-class classification problem based on financial time series patterns:

Class H: High patterns (originally HH: Higher High, LH: Lower High)
Class L: Low patterns (originally HL: Higher Low, LL: Lower Low)
Class None: No clear pattern or missing data
The original 5-class labels have been consolidated to create a more balanced and interpretable classification task.

Files Description

Important: Predictions must be one of the valid class values: H, L, None
solution.csv (Competition Setup)
Ground truth data for scoring submissions
Columns: id, class_label, Usage
Usage column determines public/private test split:
"Public": Used for public leaderboard (visible during competition)
"Private": Used for final private leaderboard (determines winners)
Approximately 30% public, 70% private split
Column Descriptions
Metadata Columns
id: Unique identifier for test set predictions (test.csv only)
ticker_id: Anonymous identifier for the financial instrument (001, 002, etc.)
Each ticker represents a different financial time series
Use this to understand which samples belong to the same instrument
Consider ticker-specific patterns in your modeling
t: Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD format)
Time series data spanning from 2023-04-03 to 2025-01-31
Data is chronologically ordered within each ticker
Feature Columns (68504 total)
The dataset contains various technical and fundamental features derived from financial time series data.
Note: Sensitive columns containing price information, returns, and PnL data have been removed to ensure anonymization.

Target Column
class_label: Classification target (present in train.csv only)
3-class classification: H, L, None
H: High patterns (HH: Higher High, LH: Lower High trends)
L: Low patterns (HL: Higher Low, LL: Lower Low trends)
None: No clear pattern or missing data
Target to predict for the test set
Data Characteristics

...
Important: Ensure your predictions only contain valid class values: H, L, None

Important Notes About ticker_id
ticker_id is crucial for understanding the data structure
Each ticker (001, 002, etc.) represents a different financial instrument
Time series patterns may vary significantly between tickers
Consider both:
Within-ticker patterns: How each instrument behaves over time
Cross-ticker patterns: Common behaviors across different instruments
Data Preprocessing Notes
All financial instruments have been anonymized as ticker_id (001, 002, etc.)
The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed
Sensitive price and return information has been removed
Time series data maintains chronological order within each ticker
Features have been normalized/standardized where appropriate
Tips for Participants
Temporal Modeling: Explore time-based patterns within each ticker using the 't' column
Ticker-Specific Features: Consider creating features that capture each ticker's unique behavior
Cross-Ticker Analysis: Look for patterns that generalize across different instruments
Feature Engineering: The temporal dimension and ticker grouping offer rich opportunities
Ensemble Methods: Often work well on financial time series data
3-Class Strategy: Consider the semantic meaning of H/L patterns vs None when designing features
Class Imbalance: Handle the imbalanced nature of pattern detection (many None vs fewer H/L)
Time Series Validation: Use time-aware cross-validation strategies
Ticker Leakage: Be careful not to use future information when creating features
Pattern Recognition: Focus on features that can distinguish trend patterns (H vs L) from noise (None)
Data Usage Strategy
Consider these modeling approaches:

Global Model: Train one model on all tickers
Ticker-Specific Models: Train separate models for each ticker
Hierarchical Models: Combine global and ticker-specific approaches
Transfer Learning: Use patterns from well-represented tickers for sparse ones
Good luck with your predictions!
